## Description
Our group investigates  and models how road users behave
and interact with  each other to safely  complete their
journeys. Currently  we focus on drivers and cyclists and
their  interaction  with  automated vehicles.

Our work is rooted in cognitive  science and neuroscience,
combines engineering  and human factors, and relies  on
naturalistic  and experimental  data.

Our research informs the development and evaluation  of
active safety systems and automated vehicles. Our results
support policy makers and road authorities  in their
decision making.
